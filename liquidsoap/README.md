**Auto DJ** allows you to keep your radio station online 24/7.

It is designed to automate the process of playing music and managing the audio content without the need for a human DJ.
The automated software essentially acts as a virtual DJ, allowing continuous playback of music and maintaining a smooth flow of
programming. It combines scheduling, playlist management, seamless transitions, and other intelligent features to mimic
the presence of a human DJ and deliver a high-quality radio broadcast.


### Features

- **Scheduling and playlist management**

    Auto DJ allows radio station administrators to create and manage playlists according to specific time slots or
    genres. It enables the scheduling of music tracks, advertisements, jingles, and other audio content for a seamless
    broadcasting experience.


- **Rotation and sequencing**

    Rotation refers to the distribution of songs in a playlist to ensure variety and prevent excessive repetition.
    Sequencing involves arranging the songs in a logical order based on factors like tempo, mood, genre, or listener
    preferences.
  

- **Crossfading and smooth transitions**

    Crossfading techniques are intended to smoothly transition between songs. This eliminates abrupt stops or gaps
    between tracks, maintaining a continuous stream of music for listeners. It helps to create a professional and
    polished sound, similar to what a human DJ would achieve manually.


- **Music library management**

    Integration with a music library or database allowing station managers to organize and categorize
    their music collections. This enables easy search and retrieval of tracks, and it may include features like metadata
    editing, album art management, and integration with online music databases.


- **Randomization and shuffle**

    Those options keep the listening experience fresh. This feature selects songs from the playlist in a non-sequential
    order, adding an element of surprise and variety to the broadcast. 


- **Live broadcasting integration**

    While the Auto DJ handles most of the broadcasting tasks automatically, it can seamlessly switch to live
    broadcasting when a human DJ is ready to take over. This integration allows for a smooth transition between
    automated and live content, maintaining a continuous stream of audio for listeners.

We are using the Liquidsoap tool to automate the radio station on the server side.
